echo "🔍 Testing Firestore Client Permissions Fix"
echo "=========================================="

echo ""
echo "📋 Summary of the issue:"
echo "- User seeing 'Missing or insufficient permissions' in Order History"
echo "- Issue was in Firestore security rules using wrong field name"
echo "- Rules were checking 'customer.uid' but orders use 'userId'"

echo ""
echo "🔧 Fix applied:"
echo "- Updated firestore.rules: customer.uid → userId"
echo "- Deployed rules to Firebase successfully"

echo ""
echo "✅ Expected behavior now:"
echo "- Users should be able to read their own orders (where userId == auth.uid)"
echo "- Agents can read assigned orders"
echo "- Admins can read all orders"

echo ""
echo "🧪 To test the fix:"
echo "1. Open your application: http://localhost:9002"
echo "2. Log in with a user account"
echo "3. Go to Dashboard → Order History"
echo "4. Orders should now load without permission errors"

echo "🚨 If you still see permission errors:"
echo "- Clear browser cache/localStorage"
echo "- Check browser dev tools for specific error messages"
echo "- Verify user is properly authenticated"
echo "- Check Firebase Console → Authentication → Users for user data"
